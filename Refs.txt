The 1991 compilation:
Kluwer '91, _Generalized LR Parsing_, Tomita ed., 0-7923-9201-9

This book started out as part of the proceedings of the 1st int'l workshop on parsing technologies in '89 and then grew.
It contains some performance studies, some related algorithms, and 2 fixes to Tomita:
one reduces (or claims to reduce) the time bound to O(n^3) regardless of the grammar -
the original version was O(n^k) where k is the length of the longest production, I think;
one is a treatment of cyclicity and so on.
I'm not positive they're compatible; the book arrived as I ended that project so it got read but not closely.

Rewritten in C++, expanded to include handling for attributes and scaled up to handle large lexicons.
