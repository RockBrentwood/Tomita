Kluwer '91, _Generalized LR Parsing_, Tomita ed., 0-7923-9201-9

This book started out as part of the proceedings of the 1st int'l
workshop on parsing technologies in '89 and then grew. It contains
some performance studies, some related algorithms, and 2 fixes to
Tomita: one reduces (or claims to reduce) the time bound to O(n^3)
regardless of the grammar - the original version was O(n^k) where k is
the length of the longest production, I think; one is a treatment of
cyclicity and so on. I'm not positive they're compatible; the book
arrived as I ended that project so it got read but not closely.
